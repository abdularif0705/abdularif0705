## About Me

<p>I am a fourth-year student pursuing a double major in Business Administration and Computer Science specializing in Supply Chain and Business Analytics at the University of Windsor. As a student, I'm fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to be a Research Assistant, Software Engineer Intern twice, and Teaching Assistant twice during my time as a student.

Right now as a Research Assistant, I am developing an iOS app using Flutter for a rust control company. I converted MATLAB code to C code and integrated it into a Flutter app.

During my Software Engineer Internship at TD, I rebuilt an existing automated Java tool used by 50+ data engineers, to meet Enterprise standards - Implemented the 4 pillars of OOP, Spring framework, Swagger to interact with Delphix Masking API, and Factory design pattern. I developed and ran unit tests using Mockito/JUnit, and used Spring to handle dependency injection of mocked objects. I onboarded new SWEs to the team by explaining the Java code for the Delphix API automation masking engine. I worked with Bitbucket, handled Git merge conflicts and reviewed pull requests sent by team members. I built a method in Java to bypass SSL verification by giving the server a certificate to make API calls over a secure HTTPS server.

When I interned as a Software Developer at OceanSource Technologies, I designed a database structure using MySQL, so my team could store sensitive medical data to be analyzed with machine learning. During the internship, I started learning python to integrate information into the database. At the moment, I'm working as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, where I teach students how to implement faster and more efficient algorithms in Java. Furthermore, I've learned my technical skills through my various side projects, and experiences as a software engineering intern, as a Code Sensei at Code Ninja, as a TA for the Computer Networks course and in my TA position for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. This is shown through the fact that my team won 1st place out of 50+ competing teams at BorderHacks2021 for the Traffic Data Challenge. I am an avid learner and am always looking for opportunities to seize where I can grow my skills as a developer üí™üèΩ.
