## üìù About Me

<details> 
    <summary>Click to learn more about my journey!</summary>
    <br>
    
I graduated from the University of Windsor, with a double major in Computer Science and Business Administration, specializing in Supply Chain and Business Analytics. Throughout my academic journey, I had the privilege of being a Research Software Engineer, Software Engineer Intern (twice), and Teaching Assistant (twice).

Currently, as a Research Software Engineer at the University of Windsor, I have engineered a pivotal MATLAB machine vision algorithm for Krown, crucial for detecting and assessing vehicle rust corrosion. Utilizing RGB to HSI colour conversion and pixel thresholding, this tool opened new avenues for evaluating rust protection products' efficacy, a capability previously unattainable. My contributions also supported a university research thesis, aiding Krown in validating its products. I converted this critical MATLAB algorithm into C and developed an iOS app with Swift, enabling rust assessments directly from iPhones and enhancing field evaluation efficiency. I also developed a Python MATLAB-based application for advanced corrosion detection, streamlining the assessment process for vehicle rust analysis. The application features an intuitive GUI for image processing and key metrics calculation, including rust percentage and area.

I'm also a Full Stack Developer at Haadi Solutions Inc., a dynamic startup where I led the development of a React application for a health clinic in the United States. This resulted in an increase in online appointment bookings by 30%. I enhanced the UX/UI for improved navigation and responsiveness, elevating user engagement. I leveraged NodeMailer for multi-factor authentication to secure the application and utilized Azure for robust database management. Furthermore, I integrated Twilio to facilitate seamless SMS and voice communications, improving patient engagement and streamlining appointment notifications. 

During my Software Engineer Internship at TD, I rebuilt a Java automation engine used by over 50 data engineers, adhering to enterprise standards. I implemented the four pillars of OOP, integrated Spring and Swagger to interact with the Delphix Masking API, and applied the Factory design pattern. I significantly improved test coverage by developing unit tests using Mockito/JUnit and utilizing Spring for dependency injection from 70% to 90%. I onboarded new Software Engineers, explaining the Java code for the Delphix API automation masking engine. I also engineered a Java SSL certificate verification bypass for secure HTTPS API calls, strengthening data security protocols without compromising functionality.

At OceanSource Technologies, as a Software Developer intern, I managed the transfer of medical data to a secure SQL database on AWS. This task included enhancing performance and security features, such as data encryption and access control. Additionally, I was responsible for monitoring and adjusting AWS RDS instances, ensuring data integrity and efficient database performance. My duties also involved setting up regular data backups and performing routine database maintenance. 

As a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, I guided students in implementing efficient algorithms using Java. I have strengthened my technical skills through side projects, internships, and roles as a Code Sensei at Code Ninja, Teaching Assisstant for Computer Networks. At GrizzHacks my team won Best UI/UX out of 30+ teams; at BorderHacks, my team secured first place out of 50+ competing teams for the Traffic Data Challenge.

Driven by my passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I eagerly seek opportunities to grow as a developer. With strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, I excel in collaborative environments and consistently deliver high-quality results.
