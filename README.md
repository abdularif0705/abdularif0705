## About Me

<p>
I graduated from the University of Windsor, where I obtained a double major in Business Administration and Computer Science, specializing in Supply Chain and Business Analytics. Throughout my academic journey, I had the privilege of serving as a Research Assistant, Software Engineer Intern (twice), and Teaching Assistant (twice).

Currently, as a Research Software Developer at the University of Windsor, I have engineered a sophisticated MATLAB machine vision algorithm for vehicle rust detection, crucial for Krown's rust protection product validation. This project involved complex image processing techniques such as RGB to HSI color conversion and pixel thresholding for accurate corrosion analysis. To create the iOS app, I migrated legacy MATLAB code to C, integrated it into Swift, and optimized the code to leverage the advanced camera capabilities of the iPhone 14 Pro by utilizing dynamic libraries. Additionally, I created a Python PyQt GUI app to ensure cross-platform functionality on both Mac and Windows devices.

During my Software Engineer Internship at TD, I rebuilt a Java automation engine used by over 50 data engineers, adhering to enterprise standards. I implemented the four pillars of OOP, integrated Spring and Swagger to interact with the Delphix Masking API, and applied the Factory design pattern. I significantly improved test coverage by developing unit tests using Mockito/JUnit and utilizing Spring for dependency injection from 70% to 90%. I onboarded new Software Engineers, explaining the Java code for the Delphix API automation masking engine. Additionally, I handled Git merge conflicts reviewed pull requests using Bitbucket, and created a Java method to bypass SSL verification for secure API calls over HTTPS.

At OceanSource Technologies, as a Software Developer intern, I designed a MySQL database structure to store and analyze sensitive medical data. I also gained proficiency in Python for data integration into the database.

As a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Data Structures and Algorithms course, I guided students in implementing efficient algorithms using Java. I have strengthened my technical skills through side projects, internships, and roles as a Code Sensei at Code Ninja, TA for Computer Networks, and TA for Data Structures and Algorithms. In BorderHacks2021, my team secured first place out of 50+ competing teams for the Traffic Data Challenge.

Driven by my passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I eagerly seek opportunities to grow as a developer. With strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, I excel in collaborative environments and consistently deliver high-quality results.
